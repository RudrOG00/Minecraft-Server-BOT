# Bot Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Server Ban for Idle Activity

Your bot "BOT" appears to be banned from the server for violating Aternos Terms of Service regarding idle activity.

### Immediate Solutions:

1. **Change Bot Username** (DONE)
   - Changed from "BOT" to "UptimeMonitor" to bypass username-based ban
   - Edit `bot-config.json` if you want a different name

2. **Enhanced Anti-AFK System** (DONE)
   - Immediate activity starts within 0.5 seconds of spawning
   - Movement every 30 seconds instead of 1-3 minutes
   - Look around every 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds
   - More active jumping and longer movement duration

### Understanding Aternos Idle Detection

Aternos servers automatically ban players who:
- Don't move for extended periods
- Show predictable/robotic behavior patterns
- Violate their Terms of Service

### Alternative Server Recommendations

If connection issues persist, consider these Minecraft server hosts that are more bot-friendly:

1. **Minehut** - Free hosting, generally allows monitoring bots
2. **Server.pro** - Free tier available, less restrictive
3. **Apex Hosting** - Paid but reliable, configurable anti-idle settings
4. **Your own server** - Full control over idle detection rules

### Bot Behavior Improvements

The enhanced bot now:
- Starts moving immediately upon spawn
- Uses more varied movement patterns
- Includes realistic delays and random actions
- Performs continuous activity for first minute after joining

### Next Steps

1. Wait for current connection attempt with new username
2. If still banned, the server may have IP-based restrictions
3. Consider contacting server admin about monitoring bot usage
4. Alternative: Test with a different Minecraft server

### Configuration Tips

To make the bot appear more human-like:
- Use realistic usernames (avoid "bot", "monitor", etc.)
- Enable chat responses to interact with players
- Set longer, more varied activity intervals
- Add random delays between actions
